** Texts analysed for the study of Nergal and IGI.DU

*textToAnalyse.txt* is the dataset (each document in Lists/texts_used on its own line) used as input to fastText. The lemmas (dictionary forms) as indicated in the Oracc metadata of verbs, nouns, and adjectives are used. Rest of the words are replaced with a underline character '_'.

*igidu_textToAnalysetxt* is the same dataset as textToAnalyse.txt but all the words where the transliteration is (in our Oracc data) (d)IGI-DU have been replaces with IGI.DU instead of using the lemma indicated in the metadata.

*textsUsed* is a list of all the texts used for the dataset.
