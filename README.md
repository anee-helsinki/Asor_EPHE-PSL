## Fast(Text) Analysis of Mesopotamian Divine Names

This is the data used for and generated during our research for the article "Fast(Text) Analysis of Mesopotamian Divine Names"  published in Vanessa Bigot Juloux, Alessandro di Ludovico, and Sveta Matskevich (eds.), The Ancient World Goes Digital: Case Studies on Archaeology, Texts, Online Publishing, Digital Archiving, and Preservation.

We thank the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc) for their efforts in making linguistically annotated cuneiform texts available online. We are indebted to everyone involved in creating this research data, including the authors of the original publications and researchers who made the data Oracc-compatible and enriched it through lemmatizations and by adding other metadata. For a list of projects and their contributors, see the file OraccCredits.txt.
