## Visualization of the results (Figure number in the article)

*CubeWithVectors.pdf* is an illustration of a three-dimensional vector space with three arrows, the tips of which represent the vectors (Figure 1).

*Gods_gephi_color.pdf* is a graph produced with Gephi containing all the gods with at least 5 attestations in the dataset (and connections to the central group).

*NergalEgonetwork.pdf* is a graph with only Nergal and the gods connected to him (made with Gephi). (Figure 4)

*Nergal_egonetworkColor.pdf* is another version of a graph with only Nergal and the gods connected to him (made with Gephi).

*NergalIgiduScatterPlot.pdf* is a scatterPlot created with R Studio using Word Vectors R package that can read word vectors build with word2vecf. The vectors were produced with fastText and the wordvector_igidu.vec (see Vectors/ folder) was converted to w2v-compatible binary file with convertvec (https://github.com/marekrei/convertvec). (Figure 5)

*QueryResultsFastText.pdf* is an example of results when one queries fastText for the word for Nergal. (Figure 2)

*VectorCalculus.pdf* is an illustration of finding analogies with fastText using Akkadian words as examples. (Figure 3)
